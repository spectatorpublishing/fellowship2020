unprecedented nature. Ending the fall semester with the tragic loss of Barnard first-year Tessa Majors, we plunged into another semester only to have to evacuate campus and transition to remote learning as the world battled with the COVID-19 pandemic. The events of these months\u2014both at the University and across the nation\u2014will be documented as pivotal events in history for years to come.\n\nThroughout this time, we have striven to show how universities and colleges hold more power than just that within the realm of academia\u2014they are capable of impacting thousands of people beyond just the walls of their campuses. As students, staff, administrators, investors, and West Harlem residents continue to grapple with Columbia\u2019s global impact as an institution, we at Spectator will continue to critically engage with institutional practices and shine a light on betrayals of public trust by Columbia.\n\nThough at first glance, Columbia seems to be a predominantly academic and intellectual space, the events of this year demonstrate that there are many more facets of a multi-billion dollar institution that remain unexplored. As such, we also made the critical decision this year to expand our coverage of Columbia\u2019s relationship with the community with pieces that examine how historical factors\u2014such as the exclusion of low-income Black residents from Morningside Heights\u2014have lasting impacts on healthcare resources, public education, and more for West Harlem residents. What happens during a public health crisis when the only hospital in West Harlem is located in a neighborhood founded on anti-Blackness? While students, faculty, and administrators scrambled to leave campus, how does the University ensure the safety of the essential workers who helped those populations get home?\n\nWe invite you to take a look back on the stories that shaped a turning point in Columbia\u2019s history.",Te=d.c.div(Be(),function(e){return e.theme.black}),Fe=d.c.div(xe(),function(e){return

Very few students come to Morningside Heights because of the athletic culture at Columbia\u2014most athletes do not even come to Columbia for athletics. Most people choose to don the light blue because of the amazing resources, opportunities, and city that (once) sprawled around us.\n\nYet, as I write this letter from my bedroom downtown, on a campus of a different New York City university, I can\u2019t help but miss the sound of the buzzers at Levien Gymnasium or the feeling of walking down the hill of Baker. Athletics at Columbia has shaped not only the college experiences of the almost 800 athletes, but also those of my staff, me, and if you are choosing to read this, you.\n\nSports are a unifier: They allow people to come together in teams and communities, entities that are far bigger than the individual. Who are the fans that make up the men\u2019s basketball team\u2019s faithful? Why does the club men\u2019s ice hockey team become a home to many students? We are learning in the midst of a pandemic that has completely halted the world of sports. Despite being challenged more than they ever have before, these groups still prevail.\n\nThis year, Sports made it our mission to tell the stories of Columbia\u2019s athletic community and to show why sports at Columbia matter, not only to our Division I athletes but to the greater community as well. Our recaps strived to be more than just the box score; our profiles looked to humanize athletes, coaches, and fans; and our stories reflected the interaction between sports and society. Our stories looked past just wins and losses to really focus on the impact of both individuals and institutions on the athletic culture as a whole. We asked ourselves many questions: What are the implications of men\u2019s basketball being an uneven team, how does scheduling impact the finances of the league, and what do Columbia Athletics events look like without a marching band? These three distinct parts that make up the fabric of our athletic culture have different effects on different groups, but all come back to the same conclusion: Sports are more than just wins and losses.\n\nThis past semester has posed a real challenge for us as sports journalists. We may have been unable to create humanizing coverage from the sidelines, but throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have found dozens of stories of lost seasons, recoveries, and communities coming together in the midst of crisis. In looking at everything from Leo Pollack\u2019s struggle to once again play baseball to how the esports team raised over $6,000 for coronavirus research to the Ivy League\u2019s decision to not allow senior spring athletes another year of Ivy eligibility, we have shown what it means to have a community on campus, what happens when a pandemic threatens to break that up, and how groups have combated that force.\n\nWe hope our coverage convinces you to care about sports at Columbia and gives you a glimpse of the people who make up the greater sports community as they triumph, fail, become greater athletes in the act of trying to achieve what is deemed impossible.\n\nWith great pride and love,",author:"Lizzie Karpen",role:"Sports Editor"}),o.a.createElement(Dt,{menuItems:this.props.data.sections},this.props.data.seasons.map(function(e,t){return o.a.createElement(o.a.Fragment,null,o.a.createElement("h3",{style:{color:"white",Left:"1vw",padding:"1vh",backgroundColor:"black"}}," ",e.name),o.a.createElement(Ho,{key:t,data:e.items}),o.a.createElement(go,{key:t,data:e}))})))}}]),t}(n.Component);function Ro(){var e=Object(f.a)(["\n  color: ",";\n  text-decoration-color: ",";\n\n  &:hover {\n    color: ",";\n  }\n  &:focus {\n    color: ",";\n  }\n  &:active {\n    color: ",";\n  }\n"]);return Ro=function(){return e},e}function Po(){var e=Object(f.a)(["\n  line-height: 250%;\n"]);return Po=function(){return e},e}var No=d.c.br(Po()),Go=d.c.a(Ro(),function(e){return e.theme.white},function(e){return e.theme.blue},function(e){return e.theme.blue},function(e){return e.theme.blue},function(e){return e.theme.blue}),Vo=o.a.createElement(o.a.Fragment,null,"Dear readers,",o.a.createElement(No,null),"It goes without saying that this academic year has been anything but normal.

to you?\n\nAs I\u2019m writing this letter from self-isolation at home in Chicago, I\u2019m finding that art plays an integral role in our lives now more than ever. When we were on campus, art connected us to our Columbia community, our broader community in West Harlem, our electrifying city, and people across the globe. Now, as we reinvent our routines amid a devastating global pandemic, art reminds us that beauty and innovation can be found in unexpected (virtual) places.\n\nAs journalists, our goal is always to tap into something broader than a single story. From analyzing how Columbians practice sustainability in fashion to reporting on immersive art exhibits that grapple with the effects of climate change, we showed how art has a role to play in protecting our planet. If that\u2019s not a universal story, then I don\u2019t know what is.\n\nFrom paintings to plays to films, art is all about the representation of something\u2014a story, a feeling, an identity. Art has also long been characterized by a dire lack of representation of many groups of people, including women, people of color, and queer people. Through our coverage, Arts & Entertainment aimed to confront the troubling legacy of exclusion in the art world. We looked critically at our stages and screens, in our art galleries and Core Curriculum required readings. We also looked behind the scenes to shed light on who gets to be a gatekeeper and to explore how we can push for equity.\n\nWhile Arts & Entertainment had previously covered local restaurants\u2019 comings and goings, we strove this year to situate our Food & Drink coverage within a cultural context. From exploring Little Senegal to covering how local restaurants are coping amid the pandemic, we\u2019ve hopefully given our readers a lot more to chew on than just food, although we encourage you to eat up.\n\nIf you needed convincing, we hope our coverage this year has shown you why the arts matter. If you were already convinced, we hope we\u2019ve provided a place for you to learn about all the ways that art challenges us to imagine a better world, and how we can use art to connect with each other even when we\u2019re apart from our community in the extraordinary sleepless city that we call home.",author:"Abby Rooney",role:"Arts & Entertainment

small room of Riverside Church by pitching ideas for what we predict the Columbia community needs to know about what\u2019s happening on and around campus. Our articles capture snapshots of our shared narratives, with the goal of informing your experience at Columbia and in New York City. From mapping out the party scene on campus to interviewing the Center for Career Education and Beyond Barnard about finding the perfect internship to our guide on the different political clubs and quiz about whom your CU Valentine should be, we want our content to be reflective of the Columbia community and its needs.\n\nWhile navigating this University gets easier as the years go on, we know there is neither a perfect way to do college nor a way to predict what the experience will truly entail, which is what this semester has definitely shown us. However, what we can do is find solace in the stories we share: the hours we spend (or don\u2019t) in Butler Library, the performances we cheer on in Lerner Hall, the tears we shed over friendship in our first-year dorms, and the rays of sunlight we scramble to absorb on Low Steps when the temperature rises above 70 degrees. This is the spectrum of experiences that we accumulate at our University.\n\nEven as COVID-19 has disrupted our spectrum, we hope to have played a role in providing comfort and resources to help you cope with the new uncertainties in your lives. Though we finish up the school year without the familiar scenes of cherry blossoms, we hope that you have been able to open our articles and find a semblance of normality, community, and support.\n\nHere\u2019s to our time at 116th and Broadway,",author:"Jazilah Salam",role:"Deputy Spectrum Editor"}),o.a.createElement(Dt,{menuItems:this.props.data.sections},this.props.data.items.map(function(t,a){return o.a.createElement(Ur,{key:a,data:e.props.data.items[a]})})))}}]),t}(n.Component),ds=function(e){function t(e){return Object(s.a)(this,t),Object(l.a)(this,Object(h.a)(t).call(this,e))}return Object(u.a)(t,e),Object(c.a)(t,[{key:"render",value:function(){var e=this;return o.a.createElement(o.a.Fragment,null,o.a.createElement(qa,{title:"COVID-19",description:this.props.data.blurb,img_src:this.props.data.img}),o.a.createElement(xn,{letter:"Dear readers,\n\nIt\u2019s been quite an eventful year\u2014one that feels like a decade, given the severity of recent events. This year has been one of many firsts, and Copy has been working tirelessly to make sure our content has been accessible, eloquent, and truthful.\n\nThis semester, the coronavirus pandemic has presented extraordinary challenges to the Columbia community and the rest of the world. Copy has been following the guidance of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to ensure that the Spectator refrains from publishing factual inaccuracies. Even something as seemingly simple as using the right terminology\u2014classifying the outbreak as a pandemic, referring to COVID-19 as a disease, and knowing social distancing from self-isolation\u2014is important to stop the spread of misinformation.\n\nThis diligence to the truth extends beyond just our coronavirus coverage. After the Spectator office closed for finals last semester, Copy scoured the Internet, police reports, and source emails to make sure that our coverage of the loss of Barnard first-year Tessa Majors was accurate and empathetic. While other news outlets were publishing factual inaccuracies and inconsistencies about the time of death and series of events, uncorroborated speculations about what happened in Morningside Park, and smear pieces on the perpetrators and the victim in their attempts to break news, Spectator refused to trade facts for sensationalism.\n\nIn our continuing obligation to respect the communities we serve and represent their voices, we recently updated our style guide. Going against the AP Stylebook but following the lead of our Black Students\u2019 Organization in an op-ed it published this January, the Spectator now capitalizes Black in all references to a culture, ethnicity, or group of people.\n\nAt Copy, it is our greatest wish to continue to grow, to learn, to empathize, to listen, and thereafter, to act. We understand that the language we use has the power to influence popular thought on particular issues and groups of people, and we will continue to update our terminology and style guide to be respectful of all and to evolve in these ever-evolving times.\n\nPlease stay safe.

Unfortunately for the Lions, the season did not go as planned as the offense struggled to get on the board all year, finishing with the fewest points scored in the Ivy League en route to a 3-7 season.","After a 6-4 2018 season that was defined by injuries, this year was supposed to be the culmination of everything that Bagnoli had been working toward over his first four years at Columbia. The return of senior receiver Josh Wainwright, a healthy quarterback situation, and a dominant defense gave the Lions a chance to secure their first Ivy League Championship since 1961. However, the Lions stumbled out of the gates with a 1-3 record to start the season, including a 21-10 loss to Princeton in their Ivy opener. The Ivy League season was filled with high highs, like the 44-6 win over Penn that marked the largest Homecoming victory in program history, and low lows, like the 45-10 loss to eventual Ivy League co-champion Yale. While the team did not succeed as a whole, there were moments of individual success, such as senior defensive lineman Daniel DeLorenzi breaking the program\u2019s all-time sack record. Unfortunately for the Lions, individual success was not enough to make up for a disappointing season that left the Lions in the familiar position of once again hoping for a breakthrough next year.","Senior staff writer Harris Walker can be contacted at harris.walker@columbiaspectator.com.

Senior midfielder and forward John Denis was the standout player throughout this stretch, sinking the equalizer in the team\u2019s home opener against the U.S. Military Academy and helping to clinch the 3-2 win over the University of Connecticut with two goals.","Ivy play started in a promising fashion for the Lions with a 3-2 win over Brown, which was secured through strong teamwork between Denis and first-year midfielder Uri Zeitz. The team continued its unbeaten streak in the Ivy League with a 1-1 draw against Penn, during which Zeitz scored a goal within the opening minutes for the second time this season.","However, the team began to lose its defensive prowess after its first Ivy loss against Princeton, during which first-year goalkeeper Michael Collodi stepped too far out of the goal, allowing a Princeton forward to sink a shot into the empty net. The season took a turn for the worse when the Lions were shut out by Yale and lost any chance of winning the Ivy title.

In Keeley\u2019s words, Columbia was looking for a culture of \u201clove and excellence.\u201d","With this mindset, the Lions worked\u2014with newly-recovered sophomore outside hitter Emily Teehan and standout first-year outside hitter Kiara Robichaud\u2014to secure their best season in three years. They finished at 12-12 and 3-9 Ivy, placing sixth in the Ivy League. The Light Blue also won both of its matches against Penn, whose season was voided after vulgar and offensive posters were found in their locker room. A 5-9 record could have put the Lions into the conference\u2019s top half.","Throughout the season, the Lions struggled to find a balance between the drive to develop the first-year class and the need to win. As first-years adjusted to the team, senior middle blocker Chichi Ikwuazom stepped up and dominated the conference. Her 495 kills this season were the most by any player in one season in Columbia\u2019s history, and her 6.02 points (kills and blocks) per set established her rank as third in the nation.

This year\u2019s campaign began with the addition of seven first-years who helped to fill the spots that the four seniors had vacated.","The Light Blue immediately demonstrated the promise of its roster, knocking off ranked opponents No. 22 Boston University and No. 24 Maine. These wins marked the first time in program history that Columbia had defeated a ranked foe. The Lions would go on to post a 3-4 record in Ivy League play, besting Brown, Penn, and Dartmouth while falling to Yale, Harvard, Princeton, and Cornell. Columbia also demonstrated a flair for the dramatic: The team played a total of six overtime games, and its wins against Dartmouth and Penn were capped by overtime game-winners. In that victory over the Big Green, first-year forward Ellie Decker earned the second hat trick in Columbia history. But struggling in close games proved to be a persistent narrative, as losses in six games in which the Lions were only able to score one goal contributed to their overall losing record of 7-9.","With top performers returning in the years to come, it\u2019s easy to be optimistic about the future of this roster. Junior midfielder Kelsey Farkas emerged as a dominant authority, leading the team with 20 points and eight goals and earning a spot on the first-team All-Ivy League in the process. Sophomore midfielder Allison Smith provided a consistent scoring threat, matching Farkas\u2019 team-leading eight goals and winning an All-Ivy honorable mention nod. On the defensive end, junior goalkeeper Alexa Conomikes established herself as a steadying force in goal, notching 6.19 saves per game, which was good for second in the Ivy League and 10th in the nation. Conomikes also earned a spot on the second-team All-Ivy squad. Decker\u2019s late-season heroics also won her a spot on the second-team All-Ivy.
