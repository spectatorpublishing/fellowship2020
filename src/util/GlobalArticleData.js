The return of senior receiver Josh Wainwright, a healthy quarterback situation, and a dominant defense gave the Lions a chance to secure their first Ivy League Championship since 1961. However, the Lions stumbled out of the gates with a 1-3 record to start the season, including a 21-10 loss to Princeton in their Ivy opener. The Ivy League season was filled with high highs, like the 44-6 win over Penn that marked the largest Homecoming victory in program history, and low lows, like the 45-10 loss to eventual Ivy League co-champion Yale. While the team did not succeed as a whole, there were moments of individual success, such as senior defensive lineman Daniel DeLorenzi breaking the program’s all-time sack record. Unfortunately for the Lions, individual success was not enough to make up for a disappointing season that left the Lions in the familiar position of once again hoping for a breakthrough next year."]

The season took a turn for the worse when the Lions were shut out by Yale and lost any chance of winning the Ivy title. Despite a triumphant 6-1 victory over Harvard on Senior Day, the Light Blue found itself unable to salvage its season, falling to Cornell 4-0 in its last match."]

With the graduation of two of their top three offensive players and a huge incoming class of nine first-years, the Lions wanted to find a new way to play, one that embraced their tradition of camaraderie while adding accountability. In Keeley’s words, Columbia was looking for a culture of “love and excellence.”",

They finished at 12-12 and 3-9 Ivy, placing sixth in the Ivy League. The Light Blue also won both of its matches against Penn, whose season was voided after vulgar and offensive posters were found in their locker room. A 5-9 record could have put the Lions into the conference’s top half.",
                "Throughout the season, the Lions struggled to find a balance between the drive to develop the first-year class and the need to win. As first-years adjusted to the team, senior middle blocker Chichi Ikwuazom stepped up and dominated the conference. Her 495 kills this season were the most by any player in one season in Columbia’s history, and her 6.02 points (kills and blocks) per set established her rank as third in the nation. Working closely with junior setter Audrey Cheng—one of the Ivy League’s best assistors—Ikwuazom led by example.",
                "But with nearly every attack running through Ikwuazom some nights, Columbia struggled early on to find a solution when she left the court. Some nights, Teehan was able to make an impact. Other nights, first-years stepped up, like outside hitters Robichaud and Pierce Woodall. Sometimes, senior libero Kalie Wood’s digs and aces energized her teammates. But often, the team floundered.",
                "Next year, Cheng—as a seasoned senior captain—will lead a talented sophomore class that is better prepared to step up during big moments. After Ikwuazom defined 2019’s squad, the Lions must find a way to win without “the Chichi show.”"]

The Lions would go on to post a 3-4 record in Ivy League play, besting Brown, Penn, and Dartmouth while falling to Yale, Harvard, Princeton, and Cornell. Columbia also demonstrated a flair for the dramatic: The team played a total of six overtime games, and its wins against Dartmouth and Penn were capped by overtime game-winners. In that victory over the Big Green, first-year forward Ellie Decker earned the second hat trick in Columbia history. But struggling in close games proved to be a persistent narrative, as losses in six games in which the Lions were only able to score one goal contributed to their overall losing record of 7-9.",
                "With top performers returning in the years to come, it’s easy to be optimistic about the future of this roster. Junior midfielder Kelsey Farkas emerged as a dominant authority, leading the team with 20 points and eight goals and earning a spot on the first-team All-Ivy League in the process. Sophomore midfielder Allison Smith provided a consistent scoring threat, matching Farkas’ team-leading eight goals and winning an All-Ivy honorable mention nod. On the defensive end, junior goalkeeper Alexa Conomikes established herself as a steadying force in goal, notching 6.19 saves per game, which was good for second in the Ivy League and 10th in the nation. Conomikes also earned a spot on the second-team All-Ivy squad. Decker’s late-season heroics also won her a spot on the second-team All-Ivy. Next year’s squad will hold a host of promising talent that has amassed valuable experience this year, and Columbia will look to jump past the middling records of the last five years."]

The taxing day of fencing concluded with 11 members of the Light Blue qualifying for the NCAA tournament, which is one member short of a full team. Though it is notoriously difficult to win a national championship without 12 fencers, head coach Michael Aufrichtig and his team were set on trying.",

In a tied match against Penn, Minarik pulled off a 5-4 victory to keep the campaign for the Ivy title alive. At Regionals, senior Gianna Vierheller capped her final college season with a first-place finish in épée. First-year Christopher Walker shined in sabre, also claiming gold. With strong performances from young athletes and the Lions’ consistency, the team will no doubt be prepared to defend its national title in one year’s time."]

Perhaps the most memorable moment of the season was Wojdylo’s quest to retake Ivy League glory with another championship in the 100-yard breaststroke.
