I was fascinated how each of the Spec members who came to give us presentations during the workshops had all different types of personalities and identities, yet they all function under the same standards. I was so curious about how the sections work together with each other and function at such a high standard, and seeing the leaders all talk to each other made the camaraderie that allows Spec to function so well clear.",

We made fun of ourselves.",
